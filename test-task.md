# Task  
**Develop a React application incorporating a TODO list, API interaction, pagination, CRUD operations, custom design, state management through Redux or Local Storage, with optional responsive design and Docker containerization.**  

## Steps to Complete:  
### 1. Setting up the React Project:  
• Create a new React application using Create React App or any other tools of your choice.  
• Initialize a git repository and commit the changes. 

### 2. Fetching TODO List from an API:
• Choose any API for retrieving a list of tasks (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).  
• Integrate the received data into the application.  

### 3. Implementing Pagination:
• Implement pagination to manage the display of the task list.  
• Provide navigation between pages and display the total number of pages.  

### 4. CRUD Operations in TODO:
• Implement functionality for adding, deleting, and editing tasks.  
• Update the interface accordingly when changes occur in the data.  

### 5. Custom Design:
• Create a design for the TODO list and control elements.  
• Use styling with CSS or any tool of your choice.  

### 6. State Management via Redux or Local Storage:
• Decide whether to use global state management through Redux or local state through Local Storage.  
• Implement the saving of task state according to the chosen approach. 

### 7. Additional Options (Optional):
• Implement responsive design for proper display on different devices. 

## Project Documentation:
### 1. Installation and Launch:
• Provide instructions for installing dependencies and launching the project.  
### 2. Repository Link:
• Provide a link to the git repository containing the complete project code. 

## Notes:
• Code should be well-structured and accompanied by comments.   
• Documentation can be presented as a README.md file in the root of the repository.
